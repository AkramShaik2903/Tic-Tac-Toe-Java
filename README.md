Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Description:
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a console-based Java application where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid with ‘X’ and ‘O’. The game checks for a win condition (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal) or a draw if the grid is full. It provides a simple and interactive way to play Tic-Tac-Toe on the command line.

Technologies & Concepts Used:

**Java Core Concepts –** Implemented using arrays, loops, and conditional statements.
